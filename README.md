## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) aimed at shortening the system development life cycle and providing continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.
